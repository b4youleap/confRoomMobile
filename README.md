# Conference Room (Mobile)
This is a mobile starter app for an [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) Hackathon project and is akin to confroom.

At this point, although one project might serve all I am not so sure about that. It may be desirable to keep a separation for simplicity.

## This app was created with the Ionic CLI:

### Windows OS:
npm install -g ionic cordova
clone this repo
cd to confRoomMobile...
npm install
ionic serve
