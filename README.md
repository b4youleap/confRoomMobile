# Conference Room (Mobile)
This is a mobile starter app for an [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) Hackathon project and is a companion app to confroom.

At this point, although one project might serve all I am not so sure about that. It may be desirable to keep a separation for simplicity.

17 June 2017: Mock Screens
I really like the way Fidelity designed their mobile app and I'm following their design. The changes I've made so far sort of mimic it but with the intent of having the phone figure out which group of conference rooms are nearby that are unreserved or appear empty.

## This app was created with the Ionic CLI:

### Windows OS:
    npm install -g ionic cordova
clone this repo
cd to confRoomMobile...

    npm install
    ionic serve
